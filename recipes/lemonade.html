    <h2>A refreshing crowd pleaser for all ages</h2>
    <p>Lemonade is just the perfect party drink.
        It's refreshing, and cold, and most people are going
        to be excited when they see it on the table. I think
        it's important to keep lemonade simple, so don't try
        to overthink it or worry that it's not fancy enough
        for your guests. It's simple, but carries its legacy
        well. There's a reason it's a staple.
