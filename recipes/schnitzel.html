    <h2>The quick, crispy chicken dinner you didn't know you needed.</h2>
    <p>Schnitzel holds a special place in my heart. There's a therapeutic element
        to the process I think. Something about smashing chicken flat, and then 
        proceeding to create a beautiful breaded meal from it satisfies my soul.
        It's like destroying a simple lego structure and then building Something
        new and exciting with the same contents. This crispy, juicy schnitzel will have your
        family asking for seconds, easily. I'm a huge fan of pairing this with bacon-wrapped
        asparagus. Enjoy!
